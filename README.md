# ASSISTments Data Mining Competition 2017 - Optional Semester Project

#### Author: Dario Anongba Varela
#### Supervisor: Louis Faucon
#### Affilitation - Professor: EPFL CHILI Lab - Pierre Dillenbourg

## Competition

The task in this competition is to develop a cross-validated prediction model that is able to use middle-school data
to predict whether the students (who have now finished college) pursue a career in STEM fields (1) or not (0).

## Dataset (in Data folder)

The dataset for this competition, in which you will predict which students have entered STEM career feels (and which haven't),
includes these 12 files:    

- student_log_#.csv (9 files), which contain the logged activity data from students' interactions with assistments ASSISTments
- training_label.csv, which contains some student-level data and the dependent measure for the training set: isSTEM.
- validation_test_label.csv contains some student-level data but not the dependent measure for the validation and test set

## Submission (oldest submission evaluated only once a day)

In keeping with cross-validation practices that are an important part of the Educational Data Mining community,
we have held out two, randomly-selected portions of this data set to be used to evaluate prediction models.   

- (1) a validation set which is being used to give participants formative feedback on their prediction models,
which they can resubmit as often as once daily between now and December 1st.  
- (2) a test set which will be used to make the final evaluation of prediction models on December 1st. 
The labels of the test set will not be available to the participants by any means.
The purpose of this set is to be used for the final evaluation of the predictions at the end of the competition.
